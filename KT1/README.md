# Vigenère Cipher Web Application

This project is a simple web application that implements the Vigenère cipher, a method of encrypting alphabetic text using a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution.

## Project Structure

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that provides the structure for the web application.
- **css/styles.css**: Contains the styles for the HTML document, defining the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects.
- **js/vigenere.js**: Implements the Vigenère cipher algorithm, including functions for encrypting and decrypting text, handling user input, and displaying results.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Enter the text you want to encrypt or decrypt.
3. Provide the keyword for the Vigenère cipher.
4. Click the appropriate button to perform the encryption or decryption.
5. The result will be displayed on the page.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript.
